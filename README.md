# Krux

Krux Development System V0.0.1

A Lua library providing access to multiple STD APIs and Unix calls.

This library DOES support cygwin, with lua-devel, lua 5.4, and lua.hpp etc found in /usr/include. Including a
windows-only script to rename cygwin's krux.so to krux.dll to support windows' lua check.
